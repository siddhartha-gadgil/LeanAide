A change of basis, picking the new vectors as the real and imaginary parts of the eigenvectors associated with the imaginary eigenvalues, reduces it to the desired form. For details on the proof we refer the reader to [20, pag. 265-271] or [19, pag. 117].\n\nThe matrix of an anti-symmetric operator \\(\\Lambda\\) has the property\n\n\\[a*{ij}=\\langle Ae*{i},e*{j}\\rangle=\\langle e*{i},A^{\\*}e*{j}\\rangle=\\langle e*{ i},-Ae*{j}\\rangle=-\\overline{\\langle Ae*{j},e*{i}\\rangle}=-\\overline{a*{ji}}\\,.\\]\n\nSince anti-symmetric operators are normal, they have a basis of characteristic values, these satisfy the above equality and are all pure imaginary.\n\nThus, in the standard decomposition described above all characteristic values are pure imaginary, i.e., \\(\\sigma*{1}=\\cdots=\\sigma*{k}=\\lambda*{2k+1}=\\cdots=\\lambda*{n}=0\\) and the decomposition in this case is\n\n\\[\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}0&\\tau*{1}\\\\ -\\tau*{1}&0\\end{array}\\right)\\\\ &\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}0&\\tau*{2}\\\\ -\\tau*{2}&0\\end{array}\\right)\\\\ &&\\ddots\\\\ &&\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}0&\\tau*{k}\\\\ -\\tau*{k}&0\\end{array}\\right)\\\\ &&0\\\\ &&\\ddots\\\\ &&0\\end{array}\\right)\\]\n\nwhich obviously has even rank.\n\n_Solution 2_.

Since \\(A\\) is skew-symmetric, all its eigenvalues are pure imaginary and from the fact that the characteristic polynomial has real coefficients, the non-real eigenvalues show up in conjugate pairs, therefore, the polynomial has the form\n\n\\[\\chi*{A}(t)=t^{k}p*{1}(t)^{n*{1}}\\cdots p*{r}(t)^{n\\_{r}},\\]\n\nwhere the \\(p\\_{i}\\)'s are real, irreducible quadratics.\n\nFrom the diagonal form of \\(\\hat{A}\\) over \\(\\mathbb{C}\\,\\) we can see that the minimal polynomial has the factor in \\(t\\) with power \\(1\\), that is, of the form\n\n\\[\\mu*{A}(t)=\\mu*{\\hat{A}}(t)=tp*{1}(t)^{m*{1}}\\cdots p*{r}(t)^{m*{r}}.\\]\n\nNow consider the Rational Canonical Form [10, pag. 238] of \\(A\\).

Notice that if \\(B*{k}\\), \\(k=0,1,\\ldots\\), are matrices such that \\(\\sum\\|B*{k}\\|<\\infty\\), then \\(\\sum B*{k}\\) converges, because the convergence of the norms clearly implies the absolute entrywise convergence.\n\nIn our case, we have \\(B\\_{k}=A^{k}\\). The desired result follows from the fact that \\(\\sum\\|A\\|^{k}/k!\\) converges for any matrix \\(A\\).\n\nSolution to 7.9.18: Note that, if \\(A\\) is an invertible matrix, we have\n\n\\[Ae^{M}A^{-1}=e^{AMA^{-1}}\\]\n\nso we may assume that \\(M\\) is upper triangular. Under this assumption \\(e^{M}\\) is also upper triangular, and if \\(a*{1},\\ldots,a*{n}\\) are \\(M\\)'s diagonal entries, then the diagonal entries of \\(e^{M}\\) are\n\n\\[e^{a*{1}},\\ldots,e^{a*{n}}\\]\n\nand we get\n\n\\[\\det\\left(e^{M}\\right)=\\prod*{i=1}^{n}e^{a*{i}}=e^{\\sum*{i=1}^{n}a*{i}}=e^{ \\mathrm{tr}(M)}.\\]\n\nSolution to 7.9.23: 1.
