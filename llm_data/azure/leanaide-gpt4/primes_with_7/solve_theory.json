    "## Solution\nWe will use the concept of Dirichlet's Theorem on Arithmetic Progressions, which states that for any two positive coprime integers a and d, there are infinitely many primes in the arithmetic progression a, a+d, a+2d, a+3d, ...\n\nIn this case, we want to find primes that end with 7, which means we are interested in primes in base 10. So we consider the arithmetic progressions 7, 17, 27, 37, ...; 17, 27, 37, 47, ...; 27, 37, 47, 57, ..., etc.\n\nEach of these progressions is of the form 10n + 7 for n = 0, 1, 2, ..., and all progressions have a common difference d=10. The numbers 7 and 10 are coprime, so according to Dirichlet's theorem, each of these progressions contains infinitely many primes.\n\nTherefore, there are infinitely many primes that end with the digit 7 in base 10.",
    "## Solution\n\nWe will use a proof by contradiction.\n\nAssume the contrary, that there are only finitely many primes which end in 7. Let them be p_1, p_2, ..., p_n.\n\nConstruct a number Q = (10*p_1*p_2*...*p_n) + 7. The last digit of Q is obviously 7, and it is greater than all the p_i. \n\nBut none of the p_i divides Q since it leaves a remainder of 7. Therefore, either Q is a prime number with a last digit 7 (contradicting our assumption that all such primes are among the p_i), or Q has a prime divisor which is greater than any of the p_i and ends in 7 (again contradicting our assumption).\n\nThus, our assumption that there are only finitely many primes ending in 7 is false. Hence, there are infinitely many primes with last digit 7.",
    "## Solution \nSuppose that there were only finitely many primes ending in 7. Let's list them as $p_1, p_2, ..., p_k$. Let's define the following number:\n\n$P = 10 \\cdot (p_1 \\cdot p_2 \\cdot ... \\cdot p_k) + 7$.\n\nClearly, $P$ ends in 7, and is greater than all $p_i$. \n\nIf $P$ is prime, then we found a new prime that ends in 7, which contradicts our assumption that there were only finitely many such primes.\n\nIf $P$ is not prime, then all of its prime divisors must end in 1, 3, 7 or 9 because of the property of decimal system. However, any prime divisor ending in 1 or 3 can't divide $P$ because it would leave a remainder of 7. Also, none of the primes $p_1, ..., p_k$ can divide $P$ because it would leave a remainder of 7. Therefore, $P$ must have a prime divisor that ends in 7 and is different from $p_1, ..., p_k$. Again, we found a new prime that ends in 7, which contradicts our assumption that there were only finitely many such primes.\n\nIn both cases, we reach a contradiction. Therefore, our initial assumption that there were only finitely many primes ending in 7 is false. Hence, there are infinitely many primes with last digit 7."

    "Theorem 1: There are infinitely many primes in the arithmetic progression a, a+d, a+2d, a+3d, ... , where a and d are coprime.\n\nProof: This is a direct application of Dirichlet's Theorem on Arithmetic Progressions.\n\nTheorem 2: The arithmetic progressions 7, 17, 27, 37, ..., 17, 27, 37, 47, ..., 27, 37, 47, 57, ..., etc., each of the form 10n + 7 for n = 0, 1, 2, ..., contain infinitely many primes.\n\nProof: By Theorem 1, as 7 and 10 are coprime, each of these arithmetic progressions contains infinitely many primes.\n\nTheorem 3: There are infinitely many primes that end with the digit 7 in base 10.\n\nProof: This is a direct consequence of Theorem 2, as all primes in the stated arithmetic progressions end with the digit 7 in base 10.

    "Theorem: There are infinitely many primes with the last digit 7.\n\nProof: For the sake of contradiction, assume there are only finitely many primes ending in 7. We denote these primes as p_1, p_2, ..., p_n.\n\nWe construct a number Q given by Q = (10*p_1*p_2*...*p_n) + 7. It is evident that the last digit of Q is 7 and Q exceeds all the p_i. \n\nHowever, none of the primes p_i divides Q because it results in a remainder of 7. Consequently, Q is either a prime number ending in 7, which contradicts our hypothesis that all such primes are contained in the set {p_i}, or Q has a prime factor larger than any of the p_i and ending in 7, which also contradicts our assumption.\n\nTherefore, the assumption that there are only finitely many primes ending in 7 is incorrect. We conclude that there are infinitely many primes with the last digit 7. QED.",
    "## Theorem\nThere are infinitely many prime numbers that end in 7.\n\n## Proof\nWe will proceed by contradiction. Suppose for the sake of contradiction that there are only finitely many prime numbers that end in 7. Let these primes be $p_1, p_2, ..., p_k$. \n\nDefine a new number $P$ as follows: \n$P = 10 \\cdot (p_1 \\cdot p_2 \\cdot ... \\cdot p_k) + 7$.\n\nFirst, observe that $P$ is greater than all $p_i$. Second, $P$ ends in 7, by construction.\n\nNow, if $P$ is prime, we have a contradiction, as $P$ is a prime that ends in 7 but is not among $p_1, ..., p_k$.\n\nIf $P$ is not prime, it must have a prime divisor. Because of the properties of the decimal system, any prime divisor of $P$ must end in 1, 3, 7, or 9. However, any prime divisor ending in 1 or 3 cannot divide $P$, as it would leave a remainder of 7. None of the primes $p_1, ..., p_k$ can divide $P$ for the same reason.\n\nHence, $P$ must have a prime divisor that ends in 7 but is not among $p_1, ..., p_k$, contradicting our assumption of finiteness. \n\nThus, we conclude that there must be infinitely many prime numbers that end in 7.\n\nThis completes the proof of the theorem."
