    "By contradiction, suppose that there are only finitely many primes that end with the digit 7, and label them as $p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$. Construct a new number $P = (10*p_1*p_2*\\ldots*p_n) - 3$.\n\nNotice that $P$ ends with the digit 7, because $10*p_1*p_2*\\ldots*p_n$ will end with a 0 and subtracting 3 changes the last digit to 7.\n\nIf $P$ is a prime number, we found a new prime number ending with 7 which contradicts our assumption that $p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$ were the only such primes. \n\nIf $P$ is not a prime number, then it must be divisible by some prime number. However, $P$ cannot be divisible by any of the primes $p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$, because it would leave a remainder of 3 when divided by any of these primes. Thus, it must be divisible by a prime number that ends with 7 and is not in our original list, contradicting our assumption that $p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$ were the only primes ending with 7.\n\nThus, there are infinitely many primes ending with 7.",
    "Assume the contrary, that there are only finitely many primes with the last digit 7, say p1, p2, ..., pn. \n\nLet P=10*(p1*p2*...*pn) + 7. \n\nP ends in 7.\n\nIf P is prime, then P is a prime ending in 7, not in our list, contradiction.\n\nIf P is not prime, then all of its prime divisors end in 1, 3, 7, or 9. It can't be divided by any prime ending in 1, 3, or 9 as it leaves a remainder of 7 when divided by 10. It can't be divided by any prime ending in 7, as it leaves a remainder of 7 when divided by any of p1, p2, ..., pn. So P must be prime, contradiction.\n\nSo there are infinitely many primes with last digit 7.",
    "Suppose that there are finitely many primes ending in 7, say $p_1, p_2, ..., p_k$. Construct a number $N$ by multiplying these primes and subtracting 10: $N = p_1 * p_2 * ... * p_k - 10$. This number $N$ ends in 7. \n\nNow, $N$ is not divisible by any of $p_1, p_2, ..., p_k$ because it leaves a remainder of 10 when divided by any of these primes. Therefore, if $N$ is not prime, any prime divisor of $N$ must end in 7 and be different from $p_1, p_2, ..., p_k$. \n\nSo in either case (if $N$ is prime or not), there is a prime number that ends in 7 and is not in the original list. This contradiction shows that there must be infinitely many primes ending in 7."
