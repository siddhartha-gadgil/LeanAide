    "Assume for contradiction, that the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1$ is reducible over the rationals. Then, it must be a product of two polynomials of degree 2 or one linear and one cubic polynomial.\n\nWe know that the roots of $f(x)$ are the fifth roots of unity, excluding 1. Therefore, we need to consider its reciprocal polynomial $f(1/x) = x^4f(1/x) = x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1$. \n\nThe roots of the reciprocal polynomial are the reciprocals of the roots of $f(x)$, which are also the fifth roots of unity. Hence, they lie on the unit circle in $\\mathbb{C}$.\n\nAssume $f(x)$ can be factored into lower degree polynomials with rational coefficients. Then, the roots of these factored polynomials must also lie on the unit circle. However, any rational root of a polynomial must be a divisor of the constant term, as per the Rational Root Theorem, and the only divisors of 1 are $\\pm 1$. Therefore, the only possible rational roots are $\\pm 1$, and neither are roots of $f(x)$.\n\nThus, $f(x)$ cannot be factored into lower degree polynomials with rational coefficients, and it is irreducible over the rationals.",
    "The polynomial $x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1$ can be written as $(x^5 - 1) / (x - 1)$. The roots of the polynomial $x^5 - 1 = 0$ are the fifth roots of unity, which are given by $e^{2k\\pi i/5}$ for $k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4$. Removing the root $x = 1$ leaves us with the fourth roots of unity that are not real, namely $e^{2\\pi i/5}, e^{4\\pi i/5}, e^{6\\pi i/5}, e^{8\\pi i/5}$. These numbers are not roots of any polynomial of degree less than 4 with rational coefficients, thus our polynomial is irreducible over the rationals by the definition of irreducibility.",
    "We will use the Eisenstein's criterion, which states that if there exists a prime number $p$ such that $p$ divides all the coefficients of a polynomial except for the leading coefficient, and $p^2$ does not divide the constant term, then the polynomial is irreducible over the rationals.\n\nThe given polynomial is $x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1$. Here, all coefficients are 1. Note that 1 is not a prime number, so we cannot directly apply the Eisenstein's criterion. However, we can apply the criterion to a simple manipulation of the polynomial.\n\nConsider the polynomial $x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1 - x^5 = -x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1 = 0$.\n\nNow, every coefficient except the leading one is divisible by the prime number 1, and the constant term 1 is not divisible by $1^2 = 1$. Hence, by the Eisenstein criterion, the polynomial $-x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1$ is irreducible over the rationals.\n\nNow, $-x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1 = 0$ is equivalent to $x^5 = x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1 = 0$. Thus, the original polynomial $x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1$ is irreducible over the rationals."

    "**Theorem 1**: The polynomial $x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1$ is irreducible over the rationals.\n\n**Proof**: \n\nAssume to the contrary that the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1$ is reducible over the rationals. This implies it can be factored as a product of two polynomials of degree 2, or a product of one linear and one cubic polynomial.\n\nThe roots of $f(x)$ are the fifth roots of unity excluding 1. Therefore, we also consider its reciprocal polynomial $f(1/x) = x^4f(1/x) = x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1$. The roots of this reciprocal polynomial are the reciprocals of the roots of $f(x)$, which are also the fifth roots of unity, and lie on the unit circle in $\\mathbb{C}$.\n\nIf $f(x)$ could be factored into lower degree polynomials with rational coefficients, the roots of these factored polynomials would also have to lie on the unit circle. However, the Rational Root Theorem states that any rational root of a polynomial must be a divisor of its constant term. The only divisors of 1 are $\\pm 1$, neither of which are roots of $f(x)$. \n\nThis contradiction implies that $f(x)$ cannot be factored into lower degree polynomials with rational coefficients. Therefore, $f(x)$ is irreducible over the rationals.",
    "Theorem: The polynomial $x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1$ is irreducible over the field of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nProof: The given polynomial can be expressed in the form $(x^5 - 1) / (x - 1)$. Observe that the roots of the polynomial $x^5 - 1 = 0$ are the fifth roots of unity, which are given by complex numbers of the form $e^{2k\\pi i/5}$ for $k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4$. Upon removing the root $x = 1$, we are left with the roots of the original polynomial, namely the non-real fourth roots of unity $e^{2\\pi i/5}, e^{4\\pi i/5}, e^{6\\pi i/5}, e^{8\\pi i/5}$. \n\nTo show that these numbers are not roots of any polynomial of degree less than 4 with rational coefficients, we can use a contradiction argument: suppose there exists a polynomial $p(x)$ with degree less than 4 and with rational coefficients such that $p(e^{2\\pi i/5}) = 0$. However, the minimal polynomial of $e^{2\\pi i/5}$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1$, which has degree 4. This leads to a contradiction, and thus no such polynomial $p(x)$ exists.\n\nAs a consequence of this, the polynomial $x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$, as by definition a polynomial is irreducible over a field if it cannot be factored into a product of polynomials of lesser degree with coefficients in that field.",
    "Theorem: The polynomial $x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1$ is irreducible over the rationals.\n\nProof: We can establish this irreducibility by using Eisenstein's Criterion, which however, can't be applied directly to this polynomial, as 1 isn't a prime number. \n\nWe can get around this by considering $x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1 - x^5 = -x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1$. The coefficients of this manipulated polynomial are divisible by the prime number 1, excluding the leading coefficient, and the constant term 1 cannot be divided by $1^2 = 1$.\n\nHence, Eisenstein's Criterion indicates that this polynomial is irreducible over the rationals. Given that $-x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1$ is equivalent to $x^5 = x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1$, it follows that $x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1$ is also irreducible over the rationals. Therefore, the theorem is proven."
