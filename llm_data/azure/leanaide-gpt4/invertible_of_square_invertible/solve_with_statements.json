    "The statement is true. If $A^2$ is invertible, then there exists a matrix $B$ such that $A^2B = BA^2 = I$. Multiplying both sides of $A^2B = I$ on the right by $A$ gives $A(AB) = I$, so $A$ is invertible.",
    "The assertion is true. \n\nThe reason for this is that if a square matrix $A$ is not invertible, then it has a zero determinant. Because the determinant of $A^2$ is the square of the determinant of $A$, if $A$ has a zero determinant, then $A^2$ will also have a zero determinant, which means $A^2$ is not invertible. \n\nSo, if $A^2$ is invertible, it cannot be the case that $A$ is not invertible. Therefore, $A$ must be invertible.",
    "If $A^2$ is invertible, there exists a matrix $B$ such that $A^2 * B = B * A^2 = I$. Now consider the product $(A * (B * A)) * A$. This is just $A * (B * (A * A)) = A * ((B * A^2) = A * I = A$. But this is also $((A * B) * A) * A = (I * A) = A$. Therefore, $A * (B * A) = I$. Similarly, if we right multiply by $A$, we get that $(B * A) * A = I$. Thus, the matrix $B * A$ is both a left and a right inverse of $A$, and therefore $A$ is invertible."

Because the determinant of A^2 is the square of the determinant of A, if A has a zero determinant, then A^2 will also have a zero determinant, implying A^2 is not invertible.

    "Theorem: Let A be a square matrix. If A squared is invertible then A is also invertible.\n\nProof: Suppose A squared is invertible. Then there exists a matrix B such that A squared multiplied by B equals B multiplied by A squared equals the identity matrix. Considering the product A times (B times A) times A, we see that this equals A since this is equivalent to A times the identity. By associating differently, this can also be seen to equal (A times B) times A squared, which equals A times the identity, hence A. Therefore A times (B times A) equals the identity. Similarly, if we multiply from the right by A, we get that (B times A) times A equals the identity. Therefore the matrix B times A is both a left inverse and a right inverse of A. Hence A is invertible."
