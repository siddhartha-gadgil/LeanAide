# LeanAide 

LeanAide or Lean**AI**de (accidental pun) is work in progress to build AI based tools to help development with the Lean Theorem Prover. The core technique we use is **Autoformalization** which is the process of translating informal mathematical statements to formal statements in a proof assistant. This is used both directly to provide tools and indirectly to generate proofs by translation from natural language proofs generated by Large Language models.

We now (as of early February 2025) have a convenient way to use LeanAide in your own projects, using a *server-client* setup which we outline below.


## Example usage

**Note:** We are migrating to a better setup, with some changes of Syntax as well. This will be stable by about September 20, 2025. We will document the new setup then. For a preview of what is coming, see the file `PlanSept25.md`. Some of the stuff in the file already works.

The most convenient way to use LeanAide is with syntax we provide that gives code-actions. We have syntax for translating theorems and definitions from natural language to Lean, and for adding documentation strings to theorems and definitions. For example, the following code in a Lean file (with correct dependencies) will give code actions:

```lean
import LeanAideTools
import Mathlib

#theorem "There are infinitely many odd numbers"

#def "A number is defined to be cube-free if it is not divisible by the cube of a prime number"

#doc
theorem InfiniteOddNumbers : {n  ∣  Odd n}.Infinite := by sorry
```

We also provide syntax for generating/completing proofs. For now this is slow and not of good quality. Experiments and feedback are welcome. The first of the examples below uses a command and the second uses a tactic. 

```lean
#prove "The product of two successive natural numbers is even"

theorem eg₁ (n: Nat) : 2 ∣ n * (n + 1) := by
  #prove
```

## Setting up LeanAide

To either experiment directly with `LeanAide` or use it via the server-client setup as a dependency in your own project, you need to first install LeanAide. 

First clone the repository. Next, from the root of the repository, run the following commands to build and fetch pre-loaded embeddings:

```bash
lake exe cache get # download prebuilt mathlib binaries
lake build mathlib
lake build
lake exe fetch_embeddings
```

Our translation is based on `GPT 4o` from OpenAI, but you can use alternative models (including local ones). Note that we also use embeddings from OpenAI, so you will need an OpenAI API key unless you set up an *example server* as descried below. Here, we assume you have an OpenAI API key.

To get started please configure environment variables using the following bash commands or equivalent in your system at the base of the repository (the angle brackets are **not** to be included in the command), and then launch VS code. 

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-open-ai-key>
code .
```

Alternatively, you can create a file with path `private/OPENAI_API_KEY` (relative to the root of LeanAIDE) containing your key.

After this open the folder in VS code (or equivalent) with Lean 4 and go to the file `LeanCodePrompts/TranslateDemo.lean`. Any statement written using syntax 
similar to `#theorem "There are infinitely many primes"` will be translated into Lean code. You will see examples of this in the demo files. Once the translation is done, a `Try this` hyperlink and code-action will appear. Clicking on this will add the translated code to the file.

Alternatively, you can translate a statement using the following command in the Lean REPL:

```lean
lake exe translate "There are infinitely many primes"
```

### Using as a dependency: server-client setup

Adding `LeanAide` as a dependency to your project is brittle and slow. In particular, toolchains need to match exactly. Further, there may be a collision of transitive dependencies. 

We provide a server-client setup that is more robust and faster, based on the **zero-dependency** project [LeanAideTools](https://github.com/siddhartha-gadgil/LeanAideTools). This acts as a client to the server in this repository.

The simplest (and we expect the most common) way to set up LeanAide to use in your project is to run a server locally. To do this, first set up LeanAide as described above. Then run the following command from the root of the repository:

```bash
python3 leanaide_server.py
```
We assume you have Python 3 installed but we only use builtin packages. If you wish to use a different model supporting the OpenAI API, you can pass parameters as in the following example where we use the Mistral API. To use a local model, you can run with the OpenAI Chat API using, for example `vLLM` and give a local url.

```bash
 python3 leanaide_server.py --url https://api.mistral.ai/v1/chat/completions --auth_key <Mistral API key> --model  "mistral-small-latest"
```

Next, add `LeanAideTools` as a dependency to your project. This can be done by adding the following line to your `lakefile.toml` file:

```toml
[[require]]
name = "LeanAideTools"
git = "https://github.com/siddhartha-gadgil/LeanAideTools.git"
rev = "main"
```

If you use a `lakefile.lean` file, you can add the following line to the file:

```lean
require LeanAideTools from git "https://github.com/siddhartha-gadgil/LeanAideTools"@"main"
```

Now you can use the `LeanAideTools` package in your project. The following is an example of how to use it:

```lean
import LeanAideTools

#theorem "There are infinitely many primes"
```

### Hosting a server

The server is by default launched at `http://localhost:7654`. This can be customized by setting the variables `HOST` and `LEANAIDE_PORT`. To use a shared server, simply set `HOST` to the IP of the hosting machine. In the client, i.e., the project with `LeanAideTools` as a dependency, add the configuration:

```lean
set_option leanaide.url <hosts IP address>:7654
```

to use the host. Further, unless you want all clients to use the hosts authentication for OpenAI or whatever is the model used, the host should not specify an authentication key (better still, start the server with `--auth_key "A key that will not work"`). The client should then supply the authentication key with

```lean
set_option leanaide.authkey? "<authentication-key>"
```

There are many other configurations at the server and client end.

### Using different (non OpenAI) embeddings

If you wish to use embeddings different from the OpenAI embeddings, for example for a fully open-source solution, you can run an "examples server" and set the parameter `examples_url` to point to it. We provide a basic implementation of this in the `example_server` directory. To start this, run the following:

```bash
cd example_server
python3 prebuild_embeddings
flask run
```

The second command should be run only the first time you set up. Once you start the server, set `examples_url = "localhost:5000/find_nearest"` to use the embedding server.

The file `example_server/README.md` sketches the configuration options and also the protocol in case you wish to make a fully customized embedding database.
