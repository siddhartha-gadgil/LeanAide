We could use this as an indirect argument for the existence of infinitely many Pythagorean triples, because for each pair of arbitrary parameters we get a distinct Pythagorean triple. \\n\\nA parametric formula for generating Pythagorean triples is given by:\\n\\na = m^2 - n^2,\\nb = 2mn,\\nc = m^2 + n^2,\\n\\nwhere m and n are any two positive integers such that m > n. \\n\\nThe following Lean code defines a function `pythagorean_triple` that takes two natural numbers `m` and `n` and returns a triple of natural numbers:\\n\\n```lean\\nimport data.nat.basic\\n\\nopen nat\\n\\ndef pythagorean_triple (m n : ℕ) : ℕ × ℕ × ℕ := \\n  let a := m*m - n*n in \\n  let b := 2*m*n in \\n  let c := m*m + n*n in \\n  ⟨a, b, c⟩\\n\\n#check pythagorean_triple \\n```\\n\\nNote that this does not prove that there are infinitely many Pythagorean triples. It simply defines a function that produces one given two parameters. A proper proof would need to show that for any triple generated by this function, the triple is a Pythagorean triple and that no two distinct pairs of parameters will produce the same triple. Furthermore, the proof would need to handle the issue of ordering (i.e., are (3,4,5) and (4,3,5) considered the same triple?). Implementing this proof in Lean 4 would be a complex and involved task.']"

It is known as the twin prime conjecture and was first proposed by Alphonse de Polignac in 1846.\n",
