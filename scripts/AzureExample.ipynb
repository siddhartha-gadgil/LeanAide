We could use this as an indirect argument for the existence of infinitely many Pythagorean triples, because for each pair of arbitrary parameters we get a distinct Pythagorean triple. \\n\\nA parametric formula for generating Pythagorean triples is given by:\\n\\na = m^2 - n^2,\\nb = 2mn,\\nc = m^2 + n^2,\\n\\nwhere m and n are any two positive integers such that m > n. \\n\\nThe following Lean code defines a function `pythagorean_triple` that takes two natural numbers `m` and `n` and returns a triple of natural numbers:\\n\\n```lean\\nimport data.nat.basic\\n\\nopen nat\\n\\ndef pythagorean_triple (m n : ℕ) : ℕ × ℕ × ℕ := \\n  let a := m*m - n*n in \\n  let b := 2*m*n in \\n  let c := m*m + n*n in \\n  ⟨a, b, c⟩\\n\\n#check pythagorean_triple \\n```\\n\\nNote that this does not prove that there are infinitely many Pythagorean triples. It simply defines a function that produces one given two parameters. A proper proof would need to show that for any triple generated by this function, the triple is a Pythagorean triple and that no two distinct pairs of parameters will produce the same triple. Furthermore, the proof would need to handle the issue of ordering (i.e., are (3,4,5) and (4,3,5) considered the same triple?). Implementing this proof in Lean 4 would be a complex and involved task.']"

It is known as the twin prime conjecture and was first proposed by Alphonse de Polignac in 1846.\n",

      "- Group (mathematics): This concept is largely referred to just as \"group\" in the field of algebra and the wider mathematical community. However, depending on the context, it might be called an \"abstract group\" to distinguish it from more specific types of groups like permutation groups, Lie groups, cyclic groups etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Function (mathematics): This term is quite standard across mathematics. Nevertheless, in some cases, it might be referred to as a \"mapping\", \"transformation\", or \"operator\" depending on the context.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Manifold: This term is also widely accepted across the mathematical community. In specific contexts, it may be referred to as a \"topological manifold\", \"differentiable manifold\", or \"smooth manifold\" to indicate additional structure.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Measure (mathematics): This term is standard in measure theory. However, in certain contexts it might be referred to as a \"Borel measure\" if it is defined on the Borel σ-algebra of a topological space, or a \"Lebesgue measure\" if it is defined on the Lebesgue σ-algebra of a measure space.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Cardinality: This term is used universally in set theory. Nevertheless, in the context of finite sets, it might be referred to as the \"size\" of the set.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Homomorphism: This term is fairly standard in abstract algebra. However, depending on the context and the structures involved, it might be referred to as a \"linear map\" (for vector spaces), \"continuous map\" (for topological spaces), or \"group homomorphism\" (for groups).\n",

      "You are mostly correct, but I would like to clarify a couple of points:\n",

      "- Countability (Uncountable): \"Uncountable\" is indeed the standard term and it is also often referred to as \"non-denumerable\" or \"unenumerable\". However, note that these are somewhat informal terms; the formal term is \"uncountably infinite\".\n",
      "\n",
      "- Condensation points: While \"limit points\" and \"accumulation points\" are often used interchangeably with \"condensation points\", there is a subtle difference. A condensation point of a set is a point such that every neighborhood of the point contains uncountably many points of the set. In contrast, an accumulation point merely requires that every neighborhood contains infinitely many points of the set (not necessarily uncountably many).\n",
      "\n",
      "- Perfect set: The term \"perfect set\" is indeed pretty standard across mathematics. It refers specifically to a closed set with no isolated points. The term \"everywhere dense\" would typically be used to refer to a set which is dense in its closure, which is not the same as a perfect set. In some contexts, a perfect set might also be called a \"Cantor set\", especially when the set is additionally totally disconnected and compact, but this is not a general synonym for \"perfect set\".\n",

      "\n",
      "- Complex plane (ℂ): This can also be referred to as the \"Argand plane\", especially in the context of complex analysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Compactness: There isn't really an alternative term for this concept that is used as widely as \"compact\", but sometimes phrases like \"bounded and closed\" might be used in the context of Euclidean space.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Continuity at a point: This concept doesn't have a widely-used alternative name, but in the context of calculus it might be described as the property that a function does not have a \"jump\", \"hole\", or \"break\" at the point.\n",

      "- Monotonic function: Alternative terms include \"non-decreasing function\" or \"non-increasing function\", depending on whether the function is increasing or decreasing respectively.
