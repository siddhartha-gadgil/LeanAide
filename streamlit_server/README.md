# LeanAide Server Streamlit

This is a web interface made using Streamlit for LeanAide + AutoTA utilities.

## Installation

It is recommended to use python virtual environment to install the dependencies. I would recommend using `[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)` for the same.

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or using `uv`:

```bash
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```
