# Topological fields

A topological division ring is a topological ring whose inversion function is continuous at every
non-zero element.

 Another good candidate is the subspace topology of $R \times R$,

In this section, we show that units of a topological division ring endowed with the
induced topology form a topological group. These are not global instances because
one could want another topology on units. To turn on this feature, use:

This section is about affine homeomorphisms from a topological field `𝕜` to itself.
Technically it does not require `𝕜` to be a topological field, a topological ring that
happens to be a field is enough.
