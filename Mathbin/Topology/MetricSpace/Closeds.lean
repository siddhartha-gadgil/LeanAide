# Closed subsets

This file defines the metric and emetric space structure on the types of closed subsets and nonempty
compact subsets of a metric or emetric space.

The Hausdorff distance induces an emetric space structure on the type of closed subsets
of an emetric space, called `closeds`. Its completeness, resp. compactness, resp.
second-countability, follow from the corresponding properties of the original space.

In a metric space, the type of nonempty compact subsets (called `nonempty_compacts`) also
inherits a metric space structure from the Hausdorff distance, as the Hausdorff edistance is
always finite in this context.
